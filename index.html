        <p>When I was small I was Katy, until I learned how to spell. Once I figured out that everyone else in my family had a name that started with C, I  insisted we change the spelling to Catey. I think of this moment often because I always felt outside of my family, different, like an alien who didn't understand, and that might be my earliest memory of it. I would soon give up trying to fit in - at least with my family.  It's funny to think about the queerness of my legal and biological families - so much repressed in older generations and so much being discovered by middle aged folks that is being truly driven by the youngest generations' clarity (and access to community and resources through the internet, but I digress.) I have thought about changing the spelling again, to Cady. That spelling feels more gender neutral. How has your name made you feel inside or outside a group? I think about it a lot...</p>

        <p>My name is Aaron. My name is the same name assigned to me by my parents at birth. I have never seriously considered changing it. Luckily for me, if I do decide to identify with a more feminine gender identity, I can always switch it to Erin. It is nice having a name with both a masculine and feminine articulation. The reason my parents named me Aaron is actually quite funny. As the story goes, my mother was in labor and about to give birth to me. My parents, being the talented procrastinators that they were, had not even considered a name for me yet. The doctor that was delivering me kept shouting at my mother "You have to BREATHE! You have to get air in! You have to get AIR IN!" Air in. Aaron. Yeah... pretty silly but I bet there have been worse naming conventions throughout human history.</p>

        <p>The choice of my name was made by my father, as my mother had previously chosen my older brother's name. Initially, my father was undecided between the names Danilo and Leonardo. However, after he discussed these options with my grandmother, who struggled to pronounce Leonardo correctly, he opted for Danilo. Within my family, I'm affectionately called Ni, a nickname that originated from my younger sister's inability to pronounce my name correctly when she was a child. This nickname was quickly adopted by everyone else in the family. At school, I was known as Dan. I always preferred being called Ni or Dan, feeling that the name Danilo was too mature for me during my childhood, while my nicknames felt much more personal and intimate. After relocating to Germany, I encountered a new challenge: many people mispronounced my name, often calling me "Danieelo," which I didn't particularly like. Although it was something I never grew fond of, I eventually became accustomed to it. I've even attempted to introduce "Dani" as a new nickname in hopes of it catching on, but so far, it hasn't stuck. The evolution of my name and its variations has been an interesting journey, reflective of different phases of my life and the people around me. </p>

        <p>My name is Kit. My mom was very adamant about giving all her children very Irish names. So when I chose my name I wanted it to have those elements of my given name because even though I didn't like my given name. I still felt like it had cultural significance. I also wanted a name that was more unique because I was always very annoyed with how it felt like everyone had my given name and there were so many different spelling variations. Kit just felt right. Now I've been Kit for 4 years.</p>

        <p>‚ÄúMK‚Äù is derived from my hyphenated last name. My first name (withholding here) was chosen by my mom after she had talked with a train conductor with my name while she was working as a dispatcher for trucking and train companies. I both of my names, but hearing MK makes me happy üòä</p>

        <p>My name starts with the same consonant noise but a different letter as my dead name did, I chose this for ease of transition and comfortability when I was 13 as well as to be different enough to feel more myself with a different letter. I do enjoy my name and when it's said it feels like me instead of the disgust of my previous name. My middle name I changed as well and I made it my mother's maiden name as she became an amazing supporter after I became an adult. I legally changed my name when I was 18 and love it now, both the first and middle. For this chat, Lime is a nickname I have had from online forums and gaming with friends</p>

        <p>I love my real name dearly, it feels 100% me, but for here I will go by Bean (yep, nonbinary). I chose this name because I would call my first cat, Luna, Bean Soup and I love the shape of beans. Luna passed away just two months ago so now it is especially significant for me to keep her in memory. I also just think Bean sounds silly and unaffiliated with gender constructs.</p>

        <p>My mom picked out my name, Fernanda, long before I was born. She had a couple of pregnancy losses before I  joined this world, so the anticipation for my arrival was great.  I arrived via C-section, and my sex was a surprise. The doctor, knowing my mom's history, handed me to her and said " here is your Fernanda. Go put her in a stroller and show her off!". I always liked my name, and so did everyone else as there were always at least 4 or 5 other Fernandas in my grade. One day I announced to the entire family that from then one I wanted them to call me "Fredu". I explained that Fredu was a nickname my friends had given me, but my sisters knew the truth that it was a name I had invented for myself. I have nothing against my given name, I actually like it. But Fredu was my first attempt at figuring out myself.</p>

        <p>The story behind my name is long, literally. There is this tradition in my dad's family of naming every boy Luiz something and every girl Ana something, which has been done for many, many generations. My dad was one of the few Passos man named differently and he resented that profoundly. Every opportunity the subject came up, he would comment how his parents denied him of his family heritage. So, when mom got pregnant there was no question on what my first name would be and they decided to call me Ana Luiza to embrace both.</p>

        <p>alex - given at birth (masc version) & shortened when I came out as trans ~10 years ago. originally my twin sister was going to be named alexandra & I was going to be something else & things swapped around at the last minute for reasons I forget. a few years ago I started using alexandrevna after learning it's my mom's middle name while renewing my passport (it's a patronymic & she hated her dad, & her other middle name is ralf, so middle name discussion was just kinda off limits growing up). currently using luci (femme shortening of lucifer) as a middle name</p>

        <p>When I'm staying (at least semi) anonymous, as I am here, I use the name Eden. It actually came from an RPG character I played years ago, a geeky scientist who wanted to study all the space slimes at the detriment to her own safety sometimes. I tend to be on the femme side of things in terms of appearance and decorations, but I also like to be neutral or more masc sometimes. Eden, as a neutral name, bridges the different aspects of my identity that seem contrary or impossibly attainable sometimes.</p>

        <p>My name is Velvet, which is chosen it because I once read (listened to an audio book of) and fell in love with Fallout: Equestria by Kkat. I had been iscolated and to see the world through Littlepip's eyes and learning of virtue just inspired me to be who I am now, at least at the start of being who I am. When I came out in 2018, I eventually chose the name Velvet after Littlepip's love interest. It's a short, friendly name that is of color rather than as an angel ("Gabriel") so I love it.</p>

        <p>My grandmother always wanted a daughter named Anna, but she had two sons (Joseph and George) and one daughter who she named after her own mother. Her two sons, when they got married and had children, only had more sons, but when her daughter (my mother) had her first child, she had a girl. When my Uncle George heard the news, he told my grandma and my mother, "Look, there is your Anna." I have always loved the name Anna and it holds a lot of importance to me, but about two years ago something felt like it was missing. After a long list of names I considered using to replace Anna, I met a friend who actually uses two names, and this blew my mind. Afterwards, I settled on Lukas as an addition to my name because I love the sound, I love the spelling, and like Anna, it is a lovely Slovak name. By combining Anna and Lukas, I feel I am able to more fully express myself and my gender as a transmasculine nonbinary person.</p>

        <p>My name is Wyatt. My parents gave me that name after going through a book of baby names, and they liked it the best. My parents related it to Wyatt Earp, so I had cowboy bedsheets growing up. I feel fine about it now, and I mainly keep it for the sake of consistency. I think it's alright for the person that I am.</p>

        <p>My name is Malia. I chose it. In that sense, of course, I didn't always have this name. Choosing my own name was a very important step in my transition process. I no longer identified with the name I was given at birth. So, I began a search for a name that I felt would suit me. That's how I found "Malia," a Hawaiian name that is rare here in Brazil. Malia means calm, and it's something I strive for every day. I've already had all my official documents amended with my true name. Nowadays, I love my name, although many people don't pronounce it correctly.</p>
